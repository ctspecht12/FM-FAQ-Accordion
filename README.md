## My process

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

This is the first project I've done that included javascript. I learned a lot about javascript functions and also learned that I have a lot to learn. I'm comfortable with HTML and CSS, but javascript really throws me for a loop.

### Continued development

I intend to continue practicing doing projects with javascript because that's where I really need to improve my literacy.

### Useful resources

- [Creating an Accordion | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w2bcqb25VQ&t=4s) by [@heyitzami442](https://www.youtube.com/@heyitzami442)- This video was incredibly helpful in teaching me the basics of creating an accordion using js. It didn't translate exactly to this project, but got me very close to a solution.

-Github/VSC Copilotâ€”I was able to get very close to a solution using the tutorial above, but couldn't figure out how to incorporate triggering the icon to switch. After about 2 hours of attempts, I finally asked Copilot what the best solution would be and why. It helped me understand it a bit better and offered me the best solution.
